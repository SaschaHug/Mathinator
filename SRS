# Unveiled - Software Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
This SRS describes all specifications for "Unveiled". It’s an Android-App enhanced with a small web interface. "Unveiled" allows
users to take pictures and videos, which are immediately sent to and stored by a server. In this document the usage of the
"Unveiled"-Android-App and the "Unveiled"-Website will be explained. Furthermore reliability, reaction speed and other important
characteristics of this project will be specified. This includes design and architectural decisions regarding optimization of
these criteria as well.

### 1.2 Scope
This software specification applies to the whole "Unveiled" application. The application consists of two parts: The first part is an
Android-App, which allows users to take pictures and videos with their smartphone. It establishes a livestream to a server which
stores the captured media in a private library. The second part is a website allowing users to browse, download and manage their own media.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations
In this section definitions and explanations of acronyms and abbreviations are listed to help the reader to understand these.

- **Android** This is a mobile operating system developed by Google for primarily use on smartphones and tablets.
- **UC** Use Case
- **UCD** Use Case Diagram
- **OUCD** Overall Use Case Diagram

### 1.5 Overview
The following chapters are about our vision and perspective, the software requirements, the demands we have, licensing and
the technical realisation of this project.

## 2. Overall Description
### 2.1 Vision
Everyday a huge number of undetected crimes are committed on this planet. Whistleblowers try to impart those crimes to the
community although politics and public authorities put rocks in their way. This project shall help these journalists and
dedicated individuals to publish and save their captured video and photo material wherefore they have perhaps put their life
at risk. Our Application addresses exactly this point.

> Citizens with a conscience are not going to ignore wrong-doing simply because they’ll be destroyed for it: the conscience
> forbids it. - [Edward Snowden]

People using our App can take pictures and videos which are immediately uploaded to our servers. There they are stored in a
private library only accessible to the owner. Through a web based interface you are able to manage your recorded content.

The following picture shows the overall use case diagram of our software:
![OUCD][]

## 3. Specific Requirements
### 3.1 Functionality - Android App
#### 3.1.1 Settings
A settings option provides the user the possibility to choose the quality of the video and photo by himself. In this menu the user is also
able to change the server connection details. See also our separate [document][uc configure settings] for this use case.

#### 3.1.2 Switch user
On this page the user is able to type in his/her login information.
If somebody has multiple users and log in information, the application allows him to switch between them as well. To see the use case diagram
of this use case go to this [document][uc switch user].

#### 3.1.3 Take Picture
The user is able to take pictures with the smartphone camera. The picture will be instantly uploaded to a server.

#### 3.1.4 Take Video
The user is able to film with the smartphone camera. The captured video material is live streamed to a server to store the
data. There is a detached [document][uc capture video] describing this use case more precisely.

#### 3.1.5 Upload File
If the automatic upload of the video or picture failed, the user is able to upload the file manually. This use case is described in [this document][uc upload file].


### 3.2 Functionality - Website
#### 3.2.1 Register for a new account
At the home page of the website there is the possibility to register for a new user. A registration is approved by verifying the user e-mail address. For more information please consider [this document][uc approve registration].

#### 3.2.2 Login-Page
The website contains a login-form for users that have already registered for an account.

#### 3.2.3 Maintain Profile
This overview page allows the user to view and maintain his profile. A more detailed description can be found [here][uc switch user].

#### 3.2.4 Media Browser
At this page all captured and uploaded media of a single user is shown. He can browse the content easily.

#### 3.2.5 Content viewer
Each uploaded file is shown in the media browser. Detailed information is shown below and in a modal dialog the video can be watched. See [this document][uc view own media] for further information.

#### 3.2.6 Delete files
The user is able to delete his own media stored on the server. [Use case document][uc delete own media].

#### 3.2.7 Download files
Captured media can be downloaded only by the owner. Therefore he is able to select specific files in the media browser for download. [Use case document][uc download own media].

#### 3.2.8 Approve registration
Users have to verify their e-mail address to approve their account. [Use case document][uc approve registration].

#### 3.2.9 Manage Users
The administrator is able to perform several different functions on user data. You can read more about this use case [here][uc manage users].

#### 3.2.10 Manage Media
Inappropriate uploads can be deleted by the administrator.

### 3.3 Usability
#### 3.3.1 Smartphone user
The user should know how to use Android as an mobile operating system and how to install and use an mobile application on it. We will provide a installation guide.

#### 3.3.2 Using a browser
The user of our website has to know how to open and work with a modern browser like Chrome, Firefox or Opera.

#### 3.3.3 Honest person
We expect the user to be a honest person, who just upload media that makes our world a better place. Our users should obey the law.

### 3.4 Reliability
#### 3.4.1 Server availability
Our own server should ensure a 90% up-time.

We will also provide an installation-kit so that every institution can host their own streaming server application. In that case the server availability is under the institutions responsibility.

#### 3.4.2 MTTR
This is also in the hands of the server owners.

#### 3.4.3 Compliant to RFCs
Our streaming server and our AndroidApp should be compliant to [RFC 2326][](RTSP) and [RFC 3550][](RTP) to be easily scalable and to ensure a stable and performant stream (also to other clients and servers if required).

### 3.5 Performance
The streaming of the media files from the Android app to the server must not guarantee real-time data transfer, because the file will not be displayed and watched live. It is just saved on the server side. But the data transfer should not take more time than twice the time of the recording had taken.

### 3.6 Supportability
#### 3.6.1 Language support
We will use the following languages, which will also be well supported in the future:

- Java EE 7 (Work on Java EE 8 is already in progress)
- Android 6.0 (Marshmallow)
- the well-known Internet Standards HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript
- PHP version 5

#### 3.6.2 Support for dependencies
We will build our own RTSP streaming library compliant to [RFC 2326][] and [RFC 3550][] in Java for our backend. Therefore we can ensure that this library is compatible with our streaming application at any time. At client side we will use libstreaming that is hosted by Github. You can find the source code and the description at their [Github-Page][libstreaming]. This library may not be supported in the future, but at this time it will be possible to us our own streaming library in the Android app as well.

Our website frontend uses Angular and jQuery for displaying the media browser and managing the HTML DOM-manipulations.

### 3.7 Design Constraints
All information about the architectural design of our application stack can be found in our [software architecture document][sad]. In the following subchapters you can read about some generall important decisions.

#### 3.7.1 Backend in Java and PHP
The backend of this software should be written in PHP and Java. The PHP-stack is responsible for a RESTful API that is used both by our webinterface and by the Android application. The Java-stack implements a powerful streaming server that uses the RTP and RTSP protocol as already mentioned.

#### 3.7.2 MVC architecture
Our Android application should implement the MVC pattern.

### 3.8 On-line User Documentation and Help System Requirements
The whole application will be built with an intuitive design, so there shouldn’t be a need for the user to ask us or the program for help. However we will write our own blog, on which users can find information and ask us questions.
